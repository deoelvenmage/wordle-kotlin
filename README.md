# Overview

A basic program to play Wordle (the word-guessing game) in the command line. It's by no means a pinnacle of engineering and has a very limited wordbank for now, but it can at least survive some errant user input.

I built this to help learn some of the syntax and ideas of programming in Kotlin. This program is well on its way to becoming my personal favorite for being a next project step after Hello World when learning a new language, cause it's simple-ish but still interesting and fun to me.

(Automatic file adding structuring might confuse things a bit; I know it does for me. You can poke around if you like, but if you're just looking for the code itself, it can be found in wordle/src/main/kotlin )

# Development Environment

Developed using IntelliJ IDEA - Community

Languages used: Kotlin (and technically Java)

Libraries used: java.util.Random

# Useful Websites

These each link to specific pages that I used while working on particular parts of this project, but each parent site is a general source I found useful as well:
* [GeeksForGeeks - IntelliJ setup](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kotlin-environment-setup-with-intellij-idea/)
* [Programiz - Walkthrough examples on variables, loops, input/output, and more](https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming/hello-world)
* [KotlinLang.org - Official Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.random/-random/)

# Future Work

* Add a larger word bank
* Store a separate file of words and read it in once
* Make it more dynamic and implement different length Wordles
